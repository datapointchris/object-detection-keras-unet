### Project Overview

### Project Structure
=====================
`data` -- Saved model(s)
`images/training/` -- 



### Next Steps
- Access to additional images from satellite sources
- Automation of image capture, scoring, and selection
- Incorporating Object detection before contouring
- Training a neural network to detect bounding boxes
- Annotation of images
